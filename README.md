# TECOmate: 

**Tools for the Enforcement of Smart Contracts On-line with MAthematics and TEchnology**.
</br>


The word **tecomate** is pronunced [te.koˈma.te] in Spanish  and probably
[te.koˈmeit] in English is the name of tree that grows in Mexico 
and Central American countries. 
</br>

We use **TECOmate** to name our Git repository that hosts the implementation
of an hybrid achitecture for the enforcement of smart contracts. It
is hybrid in the sense that it is composed of on and off blockchain
components. As such it implementation involves the integration of
several smart contracts tools.
